Hey Claude, can you create a docstring for the '[fn_name]' function defined in the file above? The doctoring should include a detailed description of the role the function plays and include a sentence describing each of the arguments in detail. The docstring should follow this format:

<docstring_example>
[docstring_example]
</docstring_example>

Only include ‘Raises’ if the function actively raises any exceptions, otherwise it can be ignored. It is critical that you only include the docstring itself, no preamble - your response needs to start with """.
